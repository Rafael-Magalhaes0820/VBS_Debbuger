# VBS_Debbuger
Application to run and "debug" VBScript code


This tool purpose is to be able to run and debug .VBS code.

I needed a tool to run vbscript line by line, but could not find one. So i made this one.

right now the feature of saving and loading files is broken. But if you just paste or write your code, it will run.

* "Run" Button will run entire code
* "Step" Button will run the next line only, and wait for the user to press it again to run again.
* "File" Will give you the option to Save or Load a file, but its not working for now. (probably never will)
